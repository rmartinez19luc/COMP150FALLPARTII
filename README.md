Time Corps

Welcome to Time Corps, a game that involves traversing through broken dimensions. You travel with four characters; a Mage, Timekeeper, Rogue, and Knight who are determined to repair their dimensions to return back to their dimensions. There are 4 portals you must travel and defeat in order to repair all the dimensions. There are the medieval, ancient, futuristic, and FINAL BOSS portals.

Bertak, the evil leader of the Three Generals, broke the legendary time machine and scattered its pieces across dangerous portals. Your mission is to explore these portals, collect the pieces, and defeat Bertak to bring balance back to the dimensions.

The game is simple but challenging. You win by finding all the machine pieces and beating Bertak, but be careful—if you run out of energy, the game is over. Pick up gems and items along the way to boost your energy and score as you make your way through the portals.

Each portal is a new adventure filled with surprises and puzzles. You’ll face challenges and meet interesting characters who guide or block your path. The story keeps you hooked, as every step brings you closer to the big showdown with Bertak.

When you win, the game celebrates with a victory screen featuring a special message and sound effects. You can choose to play again or end your journey. Sounds and music throughout the game make the experience more fun and exciting.

This game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with cool effects and sounds. Future updates might include more portals, a high-score list, or even multiplayer modes. Get ready to become the hero the universe needs!
